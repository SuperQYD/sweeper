A remote controlled sweeper bot that uses, RaspberryPI, Raspbian, 
Playstation DualShock3 controller, a bluetooth dongle, and SDL. To setup
bluetooth, take a look at this blog entry:

For SDL, install sdl1.2-dev by entering:

  sudo apt-get update && apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

The rest is a matter of installing BrickPi and it's libraries. Information
concerning BrickPi using C can be found here:
  
  www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/program-it/c

To compile it, place DexterIndustries' BrickPi.h and tick.h in the folder, then
enter:

  gcc -o sweeper sweeper.c -lSDL -lrt -lm -L/usr/local/lib -lwiringPi

The images folder has a picture of the bot, but you can always modify it or the
code to suit your needs (in accordance with CC 3.0). 

Have fun!
